Hipposan@Also called: Abdominal pregnancy, tubal pregnancy&nbsp;@<p>The uterus, or womb, is an important female reproductive organ. It is the place where a baby grows when a woman is pregnant.  If you have an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg grows in an abnormal place, outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes. The result is usually a <a data-transition='none'  data-transition='none'  data-ajax='false'   name="noreveal" href='topicinfo.html?id=764'>miscarriage</a>.</p>
<p>Ectopic pregnancy can be a medical emergency if it ruptures. Signs of ectopic pregnancy include</p>
<ul>
<li>Abdominal pain</li>
<li>Shoulder pain</li>
<li>Vaginal bleeding</li>
<li>Feeling dizzy or faint</li>
</ul>
<p>Get medical care right away if you have these signs. Doctors use drugs or surgery to remove the ectopic tissue so it doesn't damage your organs. Many women who have had ectopic pregnancies go on to have healthy pregnancies later.</p>
